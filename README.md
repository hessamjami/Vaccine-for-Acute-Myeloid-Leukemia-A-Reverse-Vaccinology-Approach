# Vaccine-for-Acute-Myeloid-Leukemia-A-Reverse-Vaccinology-Approach
Focusing on the WT1 gene, a potent cancer antigen, this study employs reverse vaccinology and in-silico design to identify novel CTL epitopes. We develop a multi-epitope vaccine targeting WT1, addressing key clinical variables. This approach promises robust T-cell responses for cancer immunotherapy.
Sequence Acquisition and Homology Analysis
We retrieved protein sequences of WT1 and its isoforms (accession no. P19544) from the Uniprot database. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using various methods to obtain a consensus sequence.
