# Vaccine-for-Acute-Myeloid-Leukemia-A-Reverse-Vaccinology-Approach
Focusing on the WT1 gene, a potent cancer antigen, this study employs reverse vaccinology and in-silico design to identify novel CTL epitopes. We develop a multi-epitope vaccine targeting WT1, addressing key clinical variables. This approach promises robust T-cell responses for cancer immunotherapy.
